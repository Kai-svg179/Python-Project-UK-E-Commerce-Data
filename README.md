# Python-Project-UK-E-Commerce-Data

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a real-world UK e-commerce dataset (available at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data]) to gain insights into the overall sales performance. 

It is intended to inform data-driven decisions around business strategies and customer engagement. 

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about customer orders, including CustomerID, Product, Revenue, Country, etc., with a total of 541,909 rows and 8 columns.

_Missing data_: Some entries for CustomerID and Description are missing, but these are accounted for in the analysis.

## Project Overview
This analysis focuses on the following key aspects:

1. **Product Analysis**:
Analyzes the distribution of revenue across products, identifying top performers and uncovering potential opportunities for growth.

2. **Sales Trends Analysis**:
Tracks monthly revenue changes, identifying patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and areas where targeted campaigns could increase sales.

3. **Customer Analysis**:
Identifies high-value customers and analyzes their purchasing behavior by region. Insights are drawn from both UK and overseas markets, helping to determine the potential for expanding the customer base internationally.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data analysis and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization (e.g., bar charts, time-series plots, pie charts).
- **Jupyter Notebooks & VS Code**: For running and documenting the analysis interactively.

## Key Findings
* **Top Products**: While a few products drive significantly higher revenue, most top-selling products have a balanced share of the revenue. Products like the 3-tier cakestand show competitive market performance and warrant further investigation.

* **Revenue Trends**: Monthly revenue generally shows an upward trend with some fluctuations. Notable changes include seasonal dips and spikes, with targeted campaigns appearing to impact sales.

* **Customer Insights**: 90.3% of customers are based in the UK, but overseas customers, while fewer, contribute a significant amount to total revenue. Particularly, Germany and France emerge as important foreign markets. The company should explore ways to expand in these regions while maintaining a strong UK presence.
